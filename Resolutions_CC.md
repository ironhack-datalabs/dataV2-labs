EXPLICIT
I have a tendency to name variables, functions etc. with unclear names out of hurry. My code should be explicit
EFFICIENT
When the first draft of the code is completed, I should look for other ways to make the code more efficient.
Efficiency is achieved by designing the code in more general terms (i.e. the calculation of the std_dev could be used in other occasions)
Efficiency is also achievec by a simplicity (i.e. if a code was 15 lines long in the first draft, it could be made shorter in later drafts)
READABLE
Keep in mind to add comments for yourself and others
CONVENTIONS
My code should, in principle, follow general conventions (i.e. PEP 8) in order to be more readable and especially to force myself into this habit
