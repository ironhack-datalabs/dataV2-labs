## Project Description
In this project, you will create your first software!
You are tasked with creating a **game** that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources you have learned during the week. Your game will be able to take an input from the user and provide an output. 

You will also present your game to the class. 

## Games
You must come to an agreement with your colleagues so that each of you develops one of the following games:

* Strong Random Password Generator
* Guess The Number
* Hangman
* Message Encryption & Decryption
* Mastermind
* Tic Tac Toe
* Blackjack
* Soldier & Dice (Risk)

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Fork and manage your own git repository. 
* Build your own code from scratch. 
* Put into practice the basic python concepts learned during the week.
* Get used to public presentations. 

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are: 
* The project must be planned, using a Kanban or Trello board. You can find a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/pc2CNZTo/project-1-build-your-own-game). Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned. 
* Your repository must be clean and organized, which means that it must include a *.gitignore* file and a README file, as well as have a well-structured file organization. 
* Your code must include functions. 

The **mandatory** deliverables that you must turn in are:
* Link to the repository you used while building your project. The repository must include all the files you used to build your game. Remember to commit often!
* Link to Trello or picture of your Kanban Board. Include the link or picture in the README file.

The **deadline** to turn in the deliverables is right before the project presentations.
