My name is Ana Santos. 

I'm from Portugal. I'm a nuclear medicine technologist and it's my first time working with programming.

I decided to study Data Analytics in Ironhack because it combines three fundamental areas like Statistics, Programming and Machine Learning.

I would like to keep working on the Health field, just more related to tecnhology.
My goals are to keep studying and growying

Hopefully I'll have a good time
