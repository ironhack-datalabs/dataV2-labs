My name is Ana Santos. 

I'm from Portugal. I'm a nuclear medicine technologist and it's my first time working with programming.

I decided to study Data Analytics in Ironhack because it combines three fundamental areas like Statistics, Programming and Machine Learning.
In my opinion everyone should learn how programming.

I would like to keep working on the Health field, just more related to tecnhology.
My goals are to keep studying and growying as a person and as a professional

The weather will be great tomorrow! Enjoy it before it's too cold again!

Hopefully I'll learn awesome things tomorrow in class and I'll have a good time
