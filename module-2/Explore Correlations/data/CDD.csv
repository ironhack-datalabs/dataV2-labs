Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Alberta and Saskatchewan	26/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	Alberta and Saskatchewan, October 26 to December 21, 2016. In late September, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) found in a cow from Alberta. The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The federal government of Canada offered to pay up to $16.7 million for ranchers who suffered agricultural loses due to the TB outbreak.				16700000	780373.8	21/12/2016 12:00:00 AM	16700000								
Incident	Technology	Hazardous Chemicals	Leak / Spill Release	Seaforth Channel BC	13/10/2016 12:00:00 AM	Seaforth Channel BC, October 13, 2016. The articulated barge and tug, Nathan E. Stewart, ran aground near Bella Bella in the Seaforth Channel. The tug, which contained 215,000 litres of diesel, began taking on water resulting in the empty barge breaking free from the tug. The tug was partially submerged and two of its fuel tanks were breached causing fuel to leak into the waters off the coast of the Great Bear Rainforest. The barge and tug, which were owned by the U.S. company Kirby Offshore Marine, were travelling south from Alaska. On October 14, two aerial flights confirmed that the sheen had spread throughout the Gale passage. Protection and containment efforts consisted of absorbent booms that were deployed around the damaged tug and booming along the Gale Passage, which included the application of petroleum sorbent. A dive team partially repaired sections of the breached fuel tanks to reduce the leakage while workers attempted to pump out the remaining fuel inside. Clean up and salvage recovery efforts were hindered by bad weather. It was not until November 15 when the tug was finally lifted out of the water and taken to shore on a salvage barge. It is estimated that 108,000 litres of fuel and 2,240 litres of lubricants were spilled. Most impacted by the leak was the Heiltsuk First Nation who closed local clam fisheries due to environmental concerns.				0	0	13/10/2016 12:00:00 AM

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontario	21/12/2013 12:00:00 AM	Southern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014. Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada’s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.  *Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made; however, no payments have yet been issued.	2	25	0	262781642	12839493.9	01/01/2014 12:00:00 AM	98581642		4200000	160000000				2490000

By December 23, over 54,000 NB Power customers were without power. A second storm tracked north along the Atlantic coast, bringing up to 30 cm of snow, causing more power outages and delays, which complicated recovery efforts. In total, over 88,000 NB Power customers (approximately 264,000 individuals) lost power over an 11-day period, with the last restorations occurring on January 3, 2014. In total, 11 individuals died during the ice storm from either vehicle accidents or carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of gas generators.	0	0	0	0	0	03/01/2014 12:00:00 AM								317000

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	Hamilton and Toronto ON	26/07/2009 12:00:00 AM	Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.	0	0	0	0	0	26/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB	24/03/2009 12:00:00 AM	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24 to May 21, 2009. Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.	0	0	3000	76506000	4012552.4	21/05/2009 12:00:00 AM	70006000	6500000						0	0
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Drought	Saskatchewan and Alberta	01/03/2009 12:00:00 AM	Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.	0	0	0	0	0	01/07/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Prince Edward Island	13/12/2008 12:00:00 AM	Prince Edward Island, December 13, 2008. An ice storm on December 13, downed 300 utility poles resulting in one of the worst power outages since the mid-1970 and cost Maritime Electric approximately $1.5 million to repair. Nearly 95 per cent of Islanders were without electricity, as freezing rain and an ice pellet-drizzle mix left thick layers of ice on roof tops, trees and transmission lines. Power poles were pulled down by ice-laden lines and strong winds. Across the province, makeshift shelters were organized in legion halls, fire stations, schools and community centres. Rescue teams and hydro crews arrived from outside the province to assist. The Canadian military also remained on standby at the Canadian Forces Base in Gagetown, NB.				0	0	13/12/2008 12:00:00 AM								127283

Disaster	Natural	Geological	Landslide	Khyex River BC	28/11/2003 12:00:00 AM	Khyex River BC, November 28, 2003. The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 metres of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. The spectacular landslide flowed downstream, crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.	0	0	0	0	0	28/11/2003 12:00:00 AM	0	0						0	0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Labrador City NL	19/01/1982 12:00:00 AM	Labrador City NL, January 19, 1982. Leading up to the January 18th event, temperatures were in the -12 to -35 degrees Celsius range.  On the 18th, temperatures decreased further to the -30 to -40 degrees Celsius range.  Winds from the west were 65 km/hr with wind gusts up to 111 km/hr occurring during the evening hours.  This resulted in wind chills of -53 to -58 degrees Celsius.  Heavy snowfall and high winds reduced visibility to near zero, and were the cause of a power outage at the Harrie Lake Trailer Court.  The outage left residents without heat or hydro, and the extreme cold caused water pipes to freeze and burst within a majority of the residences.  The Mayor declared a local state of emergency, loaders and dump trucks were brought in to create access routes, and 2,000 residents of the trailer park were evacuated to A.P. Lowe School.	0	0	2000			19/01/1982 12:00:00 AM	0	0						0	0

A severe storm hit St. John's with winds of up to 220 km/h and left 55 cm of snow on the ground.  An avalanche struck two houses and swept them down the slope, hitting two other houses.  Over 50 rescue workers and residents worked for 12 hours, digging through the snow and the debris to free trapped residents.  In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.  Inspection of the slopes has shown that a rockfall risk exists, and that The Battery is frequently affected by rockfalls.  The City of St. John's has recently constructed safety fences to protect against rockfalls and avalanches in the Outer Battery area.	5	9	0			16/02/1959 12:00:00 AM								0	0
