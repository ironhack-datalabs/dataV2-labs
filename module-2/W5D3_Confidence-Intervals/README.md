# Lab | Confidence Intervals

## Introduction

In this lab you will test your knowledge on confidence intervals and you will work with normal, student's t and chi-squared distributions. 

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Read the challenges and add your code and comments. 

You can either code your solutions using python or add your mathematical calculations using LaTeX. 

To use LaTeX in markdown cells of Jupyter Notebook you need to write your equation in LaTeX code between $ symbols. You can create equations using this [online LaTeX editor](https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php). The editor will give you the LaTeX code for your equation. 

Here's an example.

This is an equation written in LaTeX code:

```
F_{n} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left(\cfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left(\cfrac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n
```

If we write this equation between $ symbols in a markdown cell of Jupyter Notebook, we get:

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
