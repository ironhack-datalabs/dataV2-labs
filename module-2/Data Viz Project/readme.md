## Project Description
We will look production data from a raw dataset in Europe.
The goal is to observe and get conclusions from the set. The first step is to clean the dataset, make it usable, the second is to learn from this dataset by filtering element on different aspects.
I will only use Python and slides on this project.

## Dataset
There is one source :
[data.world](https://data.world/agriculture/crop-production)

## Workflow
The difficulty of this project was to show data.
There is a lot of countries, with a lot of crops type and the legend was generally bigger than the screen size so I could not show everything I wanted with some kind of plots. I had to show only samples then aggregated data.
