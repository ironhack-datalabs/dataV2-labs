# Lab | Subsetting and Descriptive Stats


## Introduction

As a data analyst you will have to work with a big amount of data. Extracting meaningful insights from your data can be done by dividing your data into subsets using Pandas library. It's a simple way to perform several types of analyses such as descriptive statistics.
In this lab, you will use Pandas library to extract insights from your data by dividing it into into several subsets. You might also need to use some Pandas descriptive statistics functions. 

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in `your-code` directory. There are 3 challenges and in each challenge you will work with 3 different datasets. All the datasets are in the `data` folder. Please keep in mind that you might also need to use some of the functions you saw in previous lessons. Remember there is a common thread! 

## Deliverables

You have here three exercises regarding three different datasets. The questions are similar so it is mandatory `to deliver just one of the exercises`. If you want to go further feel free!
- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
