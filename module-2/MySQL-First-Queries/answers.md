7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.

People tend to mostly rate social media, game, music apps. Bible app was somewhat a surprise for me. 

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.

People like sudoku, as well as playing games in general. Apps with simple and straightforward functions are also well rated, e.g. Flashlight and TurboScan. The app for learning Spanish is apparently well made and popular.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

The apps that are most often evaluated are not necessarily the apps that are considered well made and give the most satisfaction to users.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?

11. Do people care about the price of an app?Â Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

People tend to rate most actively the apps that are either free or cost no more than Eur2. (query 1) It would be interesting to explore the reasons, however, the dataset does not provide such opportunity.
 
To have a better price overview, I performed query 2. We can note that the absolute majority of the apps cost less than Eur10.

Moreover, the price of the best rated apps range from 0 to Eur 9.99. Only 5 out for the first 20 in this list can be downloaded for free. (query 3) It seems that the price is not the main factor for user satisfaction. Moreover, if the app is well made (according to final user), the user will be willing to pay.


# Query 1 
SELECT track_name, user_rating, rating_count_tot, price, prime_genre
FROM app
ORDER BY user_rating DESC, rating_count_tot DESC
LIMIT 20;

# Query 2
SELECT track_name, user_rating, price, prime_genre
FROM app
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Query 3
SELECT track_name, user_rating, price, prime_genre
FROM app
ORDER BY user_rating DESC
LIMIT 20;
