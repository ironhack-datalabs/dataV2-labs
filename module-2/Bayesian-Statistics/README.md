# Lab | Intro to Bayesian Statistics

## Introduction

In the Intro to Bayesian Statistics lesson, we covered Bayes' Theorem and Bayesian Data Analysis using a method known as Approximate Bayesian Computation. In this lab, you will practice estimating probabilities and answering probabilistic questions using the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics you learned. You will often be applying the same methods to a different problem, so how you frame the problem is especially important in these exercises.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
