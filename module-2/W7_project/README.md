# Ironhack module 2 project

## Vincent van Dijk, Cohort AMS May 2020

## Project description:
At the end of module 2 of our Data analytics bootcamp we do a project to showcase what we have learned. In my case this was around: use of Python, SQL and Tableau. Also using different types of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing will be shown in the presentation.

## Research question:
The question that will be answered in this project is:

Does international trade correlate with the price farmers get for their goods?

## Dataset
Datasets used come from the EU and FAO.
Links to EUROSTAT and FAOSTAT are given in the links section below.

## Workflow & organisation
The first two days were used to find and explore datasets.
On day three most of the analysis was done. Also first sheets were made for the presentation.
Day four and five consisted of doing last analysis, creating presentation and present the findings.
