##Challenges

### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
 

Very often these two terms (mean and expected value) are used interchangably.  However, I do not consider them synonyms.
There is a difference between the two.  
In a nutshell, the mean value is derived from a practical approach to real-life data.  This will result in a frequency distribution and a mean value.
Alternately, an expected value is derived from a theoretical approach to samples that have not been physically counted but follow probability theory.  These data sets will result in a probability distribution and an expected value.
If you can find a large enough sample size, the mean should be close to the expected value.



### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

There are many in the scientific and statistical communities who are calling for the importance of p-values to be diminished, due to a common misconception of the p-value meaning
To begin, the p-value is NOT the probability of making a mistake.  It is NOT the rate of error.  These values should also no longer be used as a basis for statistical significance.
However, it is important to note the exact p-value as it has been shown to provide important information, and be a good predictor about the replication rates for studies. It can also be used to determine which studies warrant more skepticism.



### Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.

I have chosen to look at the Sephora change to the page arrangement of Gold Members.
From what I have already learned, I would take the data from the A/B testing and implement a regression model on both sets to be able to predict conversion rates of both samples within the testing data.
Looking at the residuals and percentage error would give me an idea of how likely Set A and Set B will perform with more data points. 
I would also see if there is a correlation between time spent on page, and conversion rates for both sets.
I like to examine the visualizations of the data, so I would also look at pair plots.
