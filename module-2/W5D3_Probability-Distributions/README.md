# Lab | Probability Distributions


## Introduction

As a data anaylist, you might need to use probability distribution for several reasons: 
- To analyze data to find useful patterns.
- To make better data-driven decisions by anwering questions like 'how likely it is that an observation of a random variable occurs'.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Read the instructions and complete all the steps. 

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
