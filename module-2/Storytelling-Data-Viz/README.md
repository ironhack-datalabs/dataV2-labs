# Lab | Storytelling Through Data Visualization

## Introduction

In this lab you will practice how to tell stories using data visualization. However, you will not practice storytelling alone. Instead, you will be exposed to the complete workflow of: 

1. Understanding the dataset
1. [optional] Adjusting skewed normal distribution
1. Exploring the fields that may be interesting based on your common sense
1. [optional] Exploring the field correlations using heatmap
1. Summarizing and presenting your stories with data visualization

## Getting Started

Open `main.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the file to provide your solutions.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your version of `main.ipynb` to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
