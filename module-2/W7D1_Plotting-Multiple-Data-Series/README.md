# Lab | Plotting Multiple Data Series

## Introduction

As a data analyst, you will encounter many situations that require you to plot multiple data series. In the lesson, you learned how to leverage multi-line charts, side-by-side bar charts, and scatter plots/matrices. In this lab, you'll gain additional experience plotting multiple data series in a single visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
