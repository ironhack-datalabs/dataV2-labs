# Lab | Interactive Visualization

## Introduction

In the interactive visualization lessons, you learned how to make a variety of visualizations interactive with the use of the Plotly, Cufflinks, and IPyWidgets libraries. In this lab, you will practice generating interactive visualizations using these new tools. As with the other visualization labs, part of the process of creating them involves wrangling the data into a format that can easily be fed to the method that generates the visualization, so you will be practicing doing that in this lab as well.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
