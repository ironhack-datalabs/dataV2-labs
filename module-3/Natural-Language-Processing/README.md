# Lab | Natural Language Processing

## Introduction

In Challenge 1 of this lab we will walk you through how to prepare HTML data for NLP analysis. In Challenge 2 we will walk you through how to perform sentiment analysis on Tweets using NLTK.

## Getting Started

Complete `challenge-1.ipynb` and `challenge-2.ipynb` in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. There are two YouTube videos in Challenge 2 that you can watch to better understand how to use NLTK to perform sentiment analysis.

## Deliverables

- `challenge-1.ipynb` and `challenge-2.ipynb` containing your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
