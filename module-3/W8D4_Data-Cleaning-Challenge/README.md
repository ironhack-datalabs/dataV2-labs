# Lab | Data Cleaning Bonus Challenge
The objectives of this lab are:
* Know the Iris Dataset (you will use it tomorrow)
* Review cleaning concepts

## Introduction
As you know, data comes with a lot of errors. In this lab we propose you a challenge. We have purposely added some errors to the famous [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). Let's take a look on the data and fix some possible errors as:
* Data is encoded properly.

* Data falls within the expected range, and use domain knowledge whenever possible to define that expected range.

* Deal with missing data in one way or another: replace it if you can or drop it.


## Some advices:

* Never tidy your data manually because that is not easily reproducible

* Use code as a record of how you tidied your data

* Plot everything you can about the data at this stage of the analysis so you can visually confirm everything looks correct

## Deliverables
* A notebook with the code you used to clean the data.
* The final data in a csv.
