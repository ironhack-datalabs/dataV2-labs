# Lab | Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the News

## Introduction

Machine learning has been a trending topic in the technology media in recent years. Coverage typically includes news about new discoveries, tutorials, and profiles of individuals and teams working with the tools of machine learning.

## Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to:

* Get acquainted with recent news coverage of machine learning developments.
* Develop your critical thinking skills when reading popular coverage of data topics.

## Getting Started

You will be assigned an article to read from the selections following. Prepare a 5 minute presentation to share your research with your colleagues. After you present, we will have a 5 minute discussion as a class.

As you read and prepare to present, consider the following questions:

* How important is the development discussed in the article? Do you think it is more or less important than the headline suggests?
* Which aspects of ML or AI are relevant to this article?
* How was the relevant data collected?
* What data was used?
* How was the data modelled? What type of model was used?
* Are there any other projects you can find which apply similar techniques? For what other use cases could the techniques covered in the article be used?
* What ethical implications do you find in the article? Are there any collateral effects?
* Is there any other related coverage of this topic?

In sharing with your colleagues, the goal will be to introduce them to the topics covered in the article, and help frame a class discussion.

As you prepare, you will need to look for more information, such as:

* the paper(s) the scientist(s) published
* other articles
* information about the techniques mentioned

Feel free to present your summary and start the discussion in whichever way you prefer.
