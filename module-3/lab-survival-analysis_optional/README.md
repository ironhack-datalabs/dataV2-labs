# Lab | Survival Analysis

## Introduction

Survival analysis is an important tool for determining the survival and retention rates of different groups represented within a data set. In the Survival Analysis lesson, we learned how to generate and plot survival curves for different factors in our data. In this lab, we will continue practicing how to generate and plot these survival curves as well as how to wrangle data to generate them for groups that we are interested in but are not explicitly defined in the data.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
