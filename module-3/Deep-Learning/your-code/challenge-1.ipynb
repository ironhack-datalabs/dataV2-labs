    "In the first 9 columns of the dataset you can find which marks (`x` or `o`) exist in the grids. If there is no mark in a certain grid, it is labeled as `b`. The last column is `class` which tells you whether Player X (who always moves first in Tic Tac Toe) wins in this configuration. Note that when `class` has the value `False`, it means either Player O wins the game or it ends up as a draw."
