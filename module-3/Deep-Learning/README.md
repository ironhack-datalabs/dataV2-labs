# Lab | Neural Networks

## Introduction

This lab will let you practice performing neural network analysis. It will also introduce you additional concepts in neural network analysis and Tensorflow. You will be introduced to a web tool called [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org) with which you can play with and learn about the hyperparameters of Tensorflow.

## Getting Started

Complete Challenge 1, 2, and Bonus (optional) in order. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary.

## Deliverables

- `challenge-1.ipynb` containing your responses.

- Screenshot of your Tensorflow Playground experiment for Challenge 2.

- [OPTIONAL] `bonus.ipynb` containing your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
