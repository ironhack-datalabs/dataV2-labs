# Lab | Understanding others code

## Description
Yesterday you spent some time improving your first week's code. Today we ask you to take someone else's code and understand it. 

## Goals
This is important because you:
* Learn from others by reading their projects.
  * New methods.
  * New ways of thinking.
  * Best practices.
* Your partner learns from you thanks to your feedback.
  * He/she knows his/her strenghts.
  * He/she learns some ways to improve.

## Instructions
### You have 1h30 hour to...
* Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.
* First, understand the workflow he/she built in their improved version of their code.
* Draw / write the workflow for yourself and note your doubts about it.
* Look for things he/she made that you think could be useful for you.
* Now go to the first version of the code and compare it with the new version. Do you think the improvement is significant?
* Is the git flow useful? Does it clarify some doubts you had?
* Try the game. Do you find something that could be improved? Does something surpises you? Set some glows and grows for your partner!

### Let's give some feedback!
* Order the things you want to say.
* Look for your partner and schedule some time with him/her.
* Have a nice time!
