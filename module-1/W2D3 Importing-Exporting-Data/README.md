# Lab | Importing and Exporting Files


## Introduction

Without data, we couldn't really be data scientists. Therefore, this lab will discuss the task of importing and exporting data into pandas using different file formats.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to import and export JSON, csv, and Excel files.
## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
