# Lab | Refactoring

## Description
Let's spend some time reviewing your code now that you know a little bit more about clean code and good practices.

## Instructions
* Fork this repository.
* Add the code of your the game you coded in the first week of class. As it is, no changes! If you used *Jupyter Notebook* in your original project, your challenge in this lab is to change your project into a Python script, which means that you will turn your *.ipynb* file into a *.py* file.
* Remember what you learnt during the lesson (good practices, clean code...).
* Refactor your code! 
* Do your pull request. It should include: your original project (in a *.py* file) and the refactored version of your project. 

## Some hints
* During the refactor, commit often and describe your changes (what did you change and why?)
* Use different scripts, not only one.
