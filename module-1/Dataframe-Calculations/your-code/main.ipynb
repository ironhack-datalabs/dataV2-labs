    "# Mandatory Challenge\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "You work in the data analysis team of a very important company. On Monday, the company shares some good news with you: you just got hired by a major retail company! So, let's get prepared for a huge amount of work!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you get to work with your team and define the following tasks to perform:   \n",
    "1. You need to start your analysis using data from the past.  \n",
    "2. You need to define a process that takes your daily data as an input and integrates it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are in charge of the second part, so you are provided with a sample file that you will have to read daily. To complete you task, you need the following aggregates:\n",
    "* One aggregate per store that adds up the rest of the values.\n",
    "* One aggregate per item that adds up the rest of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import the dataset `retail_sales` from Ironhack's database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Your task\n",
    "Therefore, your process will consist of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Read the sample file that a daily process will save in your folder. \n",
    "2. Clean up the data.\n",
    "3. Create the aggregates.\n",
    "4. Write three tables in your local database: \n",
    "    - A table for the cleaned data.\n",
    "    - A table for the aggregate per store.\n",
    "    - A table for the aggregate per item.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "* Read the csv you can find in Ironhack's database.\n",
    "* Clean the data and create the aggregates as you consider.\n",
    "* Create the tables in your local database.\n",
    "* Populate them with your process."
