# Lab | Error Handling

## Introduction

In this lab we will learn how to handle errors in Python. We will handle the errors using a `try` block or an `if` statement. We will also learn how to fix errors and raise errors in our code.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to handle errors correctly or generate errors yourself.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
