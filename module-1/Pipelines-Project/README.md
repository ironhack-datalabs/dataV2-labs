# Project: Web Data Pipeline

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to practice what you have learned in the Intermediate Python and Data Engineering chapter of this program. For this project, you will start with a data set of your choice. You will need to import it, use your newly-acquired skills to build a data pipeline that processes the data and produces a result. You should demonstrate your proficiency with the tools we covered (functions, list comprehensions, string operations, and error handling) in your pipeline.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must construct a data pipeline with the majority of your code wrapped in functions.
* Each data pipeline stage should be covered: acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and reporting.
* You must demonstrate all the topics we covered in the chapter (functions, list comprehensions, string operations, and error handling) in your processing of the data.
* There should be some data set that gets imported and some result that gets exported.
* Your code should be saved in a Python executable file (.py), your data should be saved in a folder named data, and your results should be saved in a folder named output.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took and your thought process as you built your data pipeline.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A Python (.py) code file** that contains the code for your data pipeline.
* **A data folder** containing your data set.
* **An output folder** containing the output of your data pipeline.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the design and construction of your pipeline and incorporation of intermediate Python concepts as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Find a data set to process** - You can use a dataset you are familiar with like [Sharks](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1) or find another. A great place to start looking would be [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) and [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
* **Examine the data and come up with a deliverable** before diving in and applying any methods to it.
* **Break the project down into different steps** - leverage the stages of the data pipeline covered in the pipelines lesson and answer the appropriate questions for each stage.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of intermediate Python as well as some of the things you've learned in previous chapters. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.
