Create Pseudo code // diagram before starting to code.

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Variable names follow the same convention as function names.

mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

Library name should not be the same as any kind of call within the program, because it cannot be imported if its the same name.


Simple is better than complex

Explicit is better than implicit.

Complex is better than complicated

Flat is better than nested

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess

There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. But anyway, some ideas are just bad, regardless of whether they are easy to implement or not.
