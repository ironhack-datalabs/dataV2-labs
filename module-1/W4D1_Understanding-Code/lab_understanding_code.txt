Comments on Roos original code:
- The way constructed now does not work when going negative (e.g. one minus three)
- There must be an easier way to convert words to letters and back (Roos off course saw my solution with the dictionary and had an AHA moment ;-))
- I really do like the restarter idea, even if it was not working in her file
    We spend most of our time together to make the restarter idea working.
