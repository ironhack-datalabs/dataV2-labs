# LAB Good Practices
(together with Vilma and Yusi)

Variable naming:
Use variable names that make sense as much as possible.

Function naming:
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Variable names follow the same convention as function names.

Libraries:
Use one statement per line (e.g. import one library per line)
Use libraries as much as needed and don't invent the wheel again.

Community conventions:
Don't use i, I, l, L, 0, O individually.

Other (git, ...):
Be careful with everything you do outside your own computer. Before you overwrite other people's code.

Be as consistent as possible in all the above!
