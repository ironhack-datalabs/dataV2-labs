# Lab | Working with RSS Feeds

## Introduction

In the Working with RSS lesson, you learned how to parse an RSS feed with the feedparser library, explore and extract components of a feed, and perform some basic analyses on the information.

In this lab, you will practice parsing RSS feeds with feedparser and extracting/analyzing the information contained within them.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
