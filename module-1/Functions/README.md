# Lab | Functions

## Introduction

In this lab we will learn the foundations of functions. To start off, we will mostly learn how to write and think functionally. We will also implement functional transformations on pandas dataframes.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to write code functionally as well as how to apply functions to the entire dataframe in pandas.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
